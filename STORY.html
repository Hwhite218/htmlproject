<P>CHICAGO: Chicago cyclists gathered at Arc’teryx in Bucktown Thursday to learn more about Active Transportation Alliance’s petition to redevelop the Milwaukee Avenue, Damen Avenue and North Avenue intersection to be more bike- and pedestrian-friendly. </P>
<P> With more than 1,500 signatures, the advocacy group’s petition is urging the Chicago Department of Transportation, local Alderman and the Wicker Park Bucktown Special Services Area to “think big,” as they work to improve the intersection’s bike lanes and pedestrian crossings as part of the Wicker Park Bucktown Master Plan.</P>
<p>“This is really a unique opportunity with the city, the alderman and the local business community here watching this process,” said Jim Merrell, the Active Transportation Alliance’s advocacy director. “They are starting as a community this conversation, and so we really wanted to make sure that our members and supporters and all the thousands of people using the street on foot, bike and transit every day have a voice in the process.”</p>
<p> According to CDOT data, more than 5,000 pedestrians use the intersection daily during rush hours, and more than 800 cyclists cross it each morning, representing 40 percent of rush-hour traffic. Addressing attendees, Merrell said 195 cycling injuries, 54 pedestrian injuries and one pedestrian fatality were reported between 2011 and 2015, making the intersection not only busy but also dangerous for those crossing it. Attendees said “dooring,” where a car door is opened in a bike lane and hits a cyclist, is a particular concern for them.</p>
<p> “[The intersection] is very dangerous,” said Mario Marocco, a Wicker Park resident at the event. “Whenever I ride through there mainly out to work and on the weekends, I’m white-knuckled the entire time since you’re waiting for someone to open a door. I feel like it’s more the norm than the exception.” </p>
<p>The City’s proposed upgrades include better street markings to make bike lanes and crossings more visible, as well as improving turns in the intersection. Going further than these “quick fixes,” Active Transportation Alliance’s petition is asking for new bike lanes, lower vehicle speeds and more space for pedestrians and cyclists, according to Merrell and the petition’s website.</p>
<p> While the City has a shared vision with Active Transportation Alliance of making the intersection safer, they also have to consider all parties’ needs, including cyclists, pedestrians, vehicles and the business community in making these improvements, said Jerry Mandujano, the 1st Ward’s aldermanic assistant.</p>
<p>Although most attendees supported Active Transportation Alliance’s proposal, some were wary of whether these changes could improve the intersection’s safety and if they were feasible given Milwaukee Avenue’s width, said Alisa Hauser, a DNAinfo reporter at the event and Wicker Park resident. Despite her doubts, Hauser said Active Transportation Alliance’s petition is building awareness about the issue, and the solution lies in encouraging more cyclists to ride across the intersection since “there’s power in numbers.”</p>
<p>According to Merrell, Active Transportation Alliance plans to send the petition’s signatures to CDOT, the local Alderman and the Wicker Park Bucktown Special Services Area to highlight the growing support behind this initiative. A public meeting is scheduled for July 12 to discuss improvements further.</p>
